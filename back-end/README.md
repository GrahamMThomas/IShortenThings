# I Shorten Things Back End &nbsp; [![guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/Link-https%3A%2F%2Fapp.ishortenthings.com-blue)](https://app.ishortenthings.com)

> "I Shorten Things" is a bit.ly clone I used to practice building a full stack application from the ground up.

This project was bootstrapped with [SAM CLI Init](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-getting-started-hello-world.html).

## Current Data Model

Dynamo "Redirects" Table
| Key | Value |
| :---: | :---: |
| redirect_id | int |
| uses_left | int |
| can_rickroll | bool |
| url | string |

## Local Development

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Create Virtual Env
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r dev_reqs.txt
sam build --use-container
. bin/bootstrap_local_dynamodb.sh
. bin/start_local_api.sh
```

### Unit tests

Tests are defined in the `tests` folder in this project. Use PIP to install the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and run unit tests.

```bash
ishortenthings$ export PYTHONPATH=my_app
ishortenthings$ python -m pytest my_app/tests/ -v
```

## Deploy the application

The Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is an extension of the AWS CLI that adds functionality for building and testing Lambda applications. It uses Docker to run your functions in an Amazon Linux environment that matches Lambda. It can also emulate your application's build environment and API.

To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools.

- SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- [Python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)

To build and deploy your application for the first time, run the following in your shell:

```bash
sam build --use-container
sam deploy --guided # Use StackName ishortenthings-back-end
```

The first command will build the source of your application. The second command will package and deploy your application to AWS.

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
ishortenthings$ sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name ishortenthings-back-end --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name ishortenthings-back-end
```
